# Beta Testing

## CS Person Feedback

- I love the theme of the game and the challenges.
- The end screen of the game felt too abrupt and left me a bit confused, maybe make it more obvious the game ended.
- For Quest 2, I was kind of confused on where to place the word boxes. It was also showing that I passed the quest before I put the last block in place. Maybe that was just a one time error, not too sure.
- When I was playing on my big monitor, the CD player was almost in the middle of my screen so maybe you want to place it elsewhere.



## Non-CS Person Feedback

- I really like the jovial music.
- I liked how the levels had separate characters.
- Even though the game was short, I felt like the story was still really engaging.
- The music icon could be incorporated into the setting somehow, instead of just having it on the top.
- I like the design style.
