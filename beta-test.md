## Non-CS Person Feedback

- I really like the jovial music.
- I liked how the levels had separate characters.
- Even though the game was short, I felt like the story was still really engaging.
- The music icon could be incorporated into the setting somehow, instead of just having it on the top.
- I like the design style.
